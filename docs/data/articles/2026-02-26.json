While effective, existing methods rely on dense intervention at every decoding step. This persistent manipulation not only incurs substantial computational overhead but also risks compromising generation quality by excessively drifting from the model's intrinsic distribution. In this work, we show that dense intervention is unnecessary and propose Sparse Inference time Alignment (SIA), which performs sparse junction steering by intervening only at critical decision points along the generation trajectory. Our key insight is that high entropy junctions mark pivotal decision points in the generation trajectory and are particularly susceptible to misalignment, indicating the need to introduce alignment related reward signals at these p",

Synthetic data offers a practical substitute for downstream development, and large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful engines for generating it. However, existing private text generation methods are severely inefficient: they are data-intensive, computationally slow, and often require large private corpora or batch sizes to achieve usable quality. We introduce EPSVec, a differentially-private lightweight alternative that steers LLM generation using *dataset vectors*--directions in activation space that capture the distributional gap between private data and public priors.

To address this challenge, we introduce GraSPer (Graph-based Sparse Personalized Reasoning), a novel framework for enhancing personalized text generation under sparse context. GraSPer first augments user context by predicting items that the user would likely interact with in the future. With reasoning alignment, it then generates texts for these interactions to enrich the augmented context.

We study this effect as pragmatic framing, contextual cues that shape directive interpretation rather than task specification. While prior work exploits such cues for prompt optimization or probes them as security vulnerabilities, pragmatic framing itself has not been treated as a measurable property of instruction following. Measuring this influence systematically remains challenging, requiring controlled isolation of framing cues.

    "description": "In my previous blog post I mentioned the GetProcessHandleFromHwnd API. This was an API I didn’t know existed until I found a publicly disclosed UAC bypass using the Quick Assist UI Access application. This API looked interesting so I thought I should take a closer look. I typically start by reading the documentation for an API I don’t know about, assuming it’s documented at all. It can give you an idea of how long the API has existed as well as its security properties. The documentation’s remarks contain the following three statements that I thought were interesting: If the caller has UIAccess, however, they can use a windows hook to inject code into the target process, and from within the target process, send a handle back to the caller. GetProcessHandleFromHwnd is a convenience function that uses this technique to obtain the handle of the process that owns the specified HWND. Note that it only succeeds in cases where the caller and target process are running as the same user.",
